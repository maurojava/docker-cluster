This is a project forked from ramkicse /
docker-cluster.
The original repo of author is: https://github.com/ramkicse/docker-cluster.git

I have changed into docker-compose-3-7.yml file the path for volumes from absolute to relative to dir of this project.

For run this project: pull with : 
https://github.com/maurojava/docker-cluster.git

or download the zip file .
Next from console run this command:

docker-compose -f docker-compose-3-7.yml up

next go at 

localhost:8080 

or if you use docker-toolbox  
<IP_DOCKERMACHINE>:8080
